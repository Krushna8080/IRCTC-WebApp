Train Ticketing System App – Cursor AI Pre-Code Generation Rules
------------------------------------------------------------
CODE EVERYTHING ON YOUR OWN, I AM NOT HERE TO CODE FOR YOU, I AM HERE TO HELP YOU LEARN.
INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
Before starting any code generation or file modifications, please execute the following steps:

1. **Thorough Review:**  
   - Carefully read and analyze the entire content of the **context.md** file provided. This file contains the full blueprint for the Train Ticketing System app, covering all aspects—from train management and catalogue browsing to passenger addition, booking operations, cancellation, booking history, and optional search functionality.

2. **Reflect and Plan:**  
   - Take a moment to think through every detail of the project. Evaluate the detailed requirements and dependencies specified in the **context.md** file.
   - Review the Train Ticketing rule file to ensure that all dependency checks, backup routines, logging, and consistency verifications are in place.
   - Develop a comprehensive plan outlining:
     - The breakdown of each major module (e.g., train management, catalogue browsing, passenger details, ticket booking, booking history, cancellation, and search).
     - How all dependencies and file histories will be verified and maintained before making any changes.
     - Integration points with key technologies such as Node.js (backend), React.js (frontend), MongoDB (database), and any external APIs (for payments, notifications, etc.).

3. **Dependency and Integrity Check:**  
   - Before proceeding with any file operations, ensure that:
     - The current project state is consistent with the stored dependency graph.
     - All dependencies (Node.js, React.js, MongoDB, etc.) are present and up-to-date.
     - Previous file states and histories are properly backed up as specified in the rule file.

4. **Begin Creation Only After Planning:**  
   - Only once you have thoroughly planned every detail and confirmed that all dependency checks, backups, and integrity verifications are in place, begin the code creation process.
   - Ensure that all changes adhere to the industry-level rules and standards outlined in the Train Ticketing rule file.

FINAL REMINDER:
------------------------------------------------------------
Please take a moment to reflect on the entire project, develop your plan, and verify that all rules and dependencies are satisfied. Once your planning is complete and all checks are passed, proceed with the creation of the Train Ticketing System application.

Begin your planning process now.
